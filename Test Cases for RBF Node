**Title**: Bag_01: Verify ROSbag filtering by time range
**Description**: Ensure the ROSbag Filtration Node correctly filters messages within the specified time range.
**Preconditions**: 
- A ROSbag file named `bag_01.bag` is available in the `catkin_ws/bags/` directory.
- ROS environment is set up and sourced.

**Steps**:
1. Run the command: `rosrun rosbag_filter rosbag_filter_node --ros_version ros1 --start_time 10 --end_time 20 --bag_file ~/catkin_ws/bags/bag_01.bag --topics "/imu/data /front_camera/image_raw"`
2. Confirm output message "Filtered bag file created and closed successfully."
3. Run: `rosbag info ~/catkin_ws/bags/filtered_bag_01.bag`
4. Verify the filtered bag info includes only the specified topics within the time range.
5. Run: `rosbag play ~/catkin_ws/bags/filtered_bag_01.bag` and verify that the messages play correctly.

**Expected Result**: 
- The node filters messages from /imu/data and /front_camera/image_raw within the 10s to 20s range, creating a new filtered bag file.
- rosbag info on the filtered bag shows accurate metadata.
- rosbag play replays the messages correctly.


**Actual Result**: [The node processed and filtered messages correctly. The filtered bag file was created successfully, containing only the specified topics within the time range.]

**Status**: [Pass]
